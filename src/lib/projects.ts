    "A builder-style user interface library for Minecraft servers.",
    "I initially started interfaces back in ~2019, to solve the problem of efficiently writing user interfaces for Minecraft servers.",
    "The core idea is to use a Minecraft chest as a 'menu', arranging items and hijacking clicks to replicate the feel of a user interface.",
    "Minecraft wasn't well designed for this, so most developers use a library, finding an existing one or writing their own.",
    "Development continued for a while, finding a few contributors working on bugfixes and a Kotlin branch.",
    "Nowadays, it doesn't see much activity, but it's <i>mostly</i> mature, and it's on my mind to pick it back up for a few future projects :D"

    "This project started off as all good projects do: by finding a cool domain.",
    "For context, to run a Minecraft server, you usually want a script, so you don't need to repeatedly type the command. These scripts usually end up with a name like 'run.sh', 'start.sh', etc.",
    "When I saw the domain 'startmc.sh' was available, I told my friend, and we came up with the idea for a website that would generate a script, providing a few toggles for different options.",
    "We built it over a weekend, showed it to the community, and started to gain some traction! The concept was simple, but filled a large enough need that it was commonly shared to newcomers.",
    "Eventually, development slowed, and <a href='https://flags.sh'>flags.sh came along</a> to refine the concept. It's a really great site, and I'm happy to have partly inspired it :D"
